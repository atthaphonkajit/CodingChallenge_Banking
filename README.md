# CodingChallenge_Banking
A coding chellenge project

Requirements

You need to create a system for a bank. The software needs to have the following features:
1. Create accounts for customers
a. As it is a bank account, it has to be identified with an IBAN number. To generate that IBAN, use this website http://randomiban.com/?country=Netherlands to get a random IBAN.
2. Put money on accounts (when they deposit it in the bank)
a. for each deposit, a 0.1% fee is charged (eg. 1000 is deposited, then put only 999 on the target account)
3. Transfer money from one account to another one (within our system, between our customersâ€™ accounts)
